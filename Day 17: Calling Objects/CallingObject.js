// Day 17 of Javascript Challenge! Summoning the property of the object.
// Esskeetit! ;)

let master = {
    name: "J.E. B. Vidal",
    age: 27,
    moniker: "The -ish!",
    country: "Philippines"

console.log(master.moniker);
console.log(master.name);

// Has the same approach as day 16. The only difference is that Day 16 should only make an object.
// But knowing I'm the -ish, I did not only make an object, but also called it's property. Thus covering Day 17, unknowingly.
