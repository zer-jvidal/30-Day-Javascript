// Day 20 of Javascript Challenge! (Advance Lessons)
// I want to sound professional today.
// Let's be surgical with this one.

// Start

// While Loop

let counter = 1;
while (counter <= 21) {
    console.log(counter);
    counter++; // This is very important. It will help us stop the loop.
}

// End of Day 20.
// Recap: If "++" is remove, it will infinitely count. The loop won't stop.
